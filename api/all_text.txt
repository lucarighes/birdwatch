Had our grid been more reliant on the wind turbines that froze, the outages would have been much worse.

No, you need gas or nuclear.

Here we go:  Americans YOU ARE TO BLAME for my government leaving you behind. 

Sincerely, Biden.

Biden trying to take ‚Äúcredit‚Äù for indiscriminately evacuating almost 120K Afghan nationals at random while leaving behind US citizens &amp; those deemed priority. Impossible to conceive of a greater failure. This is reason Biden Admin refuses to say who‚Äôs actually on US-bound planes.

This is extremely difficult for me to say:

I once thought I truly knew Joe Biden and he helped me through pain and grief, for which I am grateful.

Joe Biden is the worst President in the history of our nation and he‚Äôs only 8 months in.

@Sue99339007 @HotlineJosh Covid doesn‚Äôt spread in schools. It‚Äôs been proven over and over and over and over again. Even the CDC said teachers do not need to be vaccinated to open schools. There is absolutely no reason for this nonsense. The harm being done to children FAR outweighs any risk to teachers.
===
@bis_de112 @BreitbartNews CDC said last summer that kids need to be in school. Every study shows covid doesn‚Äôt spread in schools. And the amount of suicides and depression is at an all time high for kids and teenagers. I wonder why?!

@BLACKMORPH @Aaron_Glantz @GavinNewsom @KateBrownForOR @JayInslee Even UCSF doctors say it is safe. Schools have been open throughout the country and it has not led to outbreaks.

@Eugene49846171 @jaythemuss2 @DrAlexZayas @disclosetv Covid-19 is a hoax. The hoax is perpetuated by the PCR test. There is no "new disease", all we've done is rename the flu and a bunch of other existing ailments to "Covid-19".

The vaccines and masks are the real disease. Welcome to The Great Reset.
===
@Niall_Boylan The Whole Covid is a hoax. The variants are lies. Covid is a Corona virus with the same symptoms or seriousness as flu or COPD or pneumonia. The treatment is also the same for COVID patients and flu patients. Read ‚ÄòThe Emperor‚Äôs New Clothes.‚Äô To see how easily people are fooled!!

Your occasional reminder that the Covid crisis hoax and the climate crisis hoax are, in fact, the same hoax.

@kksheld Unfortunately, the rationale for masking children is ignorance. We have devastated a generation of children psychologically, academically, and socially based on irrational adult fear. We have excellent data that kids don‚Äôt get serious COVID nor transmit it, and schools are safe.

@HammSanchez @NYCSchools @UFT I believe we are in the closed school mess precisely because everyone listened to how UFT "feels" and ignored actual scientific evidence that schools are safe.

@MutualAidNerd @Dave_Becker_ @newskag There have been studies after studies that show schools are safe. There will be cases inside schools. Covid isn‚Äôt going away.

@johangreg @rick4289 @cnnbrk Pandemic is over. Keep wearing your mask while vaccinated, stay home forever in your safe space, and keep being a sheep though.

@GenevieveCocoa @TimMurtaugh The science clearly shows schools are safe to reopen as they have been in other states like FL and TX for 6 months. Dems are hurting our children

Schools need to open 5 days/week. Resources @ schools need to be strengthened &amp; amplified. Ineffective instructional practices pre-covid should be reimagined. Some Ss have thrived in remote learning. Vaccines are here. Schools are safe. #mondaythoughts

@SelenialGlamour @ninaturner Proof the left only cares about the issue, and not a solution. If they solved the problem, they could no longer exploit poor people to amass power.  The answer for livable wage is skill attainment, not govt mandates. Schools are safe

@Timcast Yes vaccine shedding is a legit threat to the health of the unvaccinated. The only time i wear a mask and social distance is around the vaccinated
===
@POTUS Well the vaccinated are still contracting covid. What the problem is vaccine shedding, the vaccinated shed the virus and spread it. Then causing it to mutate. So y'all that got the vaccine are now super spreaders and that vaccine you just took is now pointless. Fact look it up!

===
@Tee_Cee_Gee @JillFilipovic And those vaccines were tested for years before the were injected.  The Covid vaccine was hardly tested and rolled out as an emergency vaccination. They still don't know what it does to pregnant women but do warn those women to not get close to the vaccinated due to "shedding".
===
@CruzinSLC @BuzzPatterson By the way, when vaccinated you can still get the virus &amp; spread it. People have actually still died from the virus after having been vaccinated. The virus is replicated in the vaccine, 1 stays in your body, &amp; the replicant is spread, it's called "viral shedding".
===
@michfisher @ryanstruyk You got injected with the covid. You're shedding the virus. Do the unvaccinated right and social distance from them and wear your mask. The "vaccine" doesn't keep you from getting the virus, it keeps you from experiencing the worst of the symptoms.  You really should research.
===
@AngelaBelcamino @JoeBiden I don't want to be sitting inside with anyone who got the vaccine.   Look up spike protein "shedding" or whatever term you want to use
===
@bickley200 @AaronTompson2 @KazNan3 That's not true. Shedding from vaccines has been legalized in Germany. If shedding wasn't possible, there wouldn't be a need to regulate it and "restrict the right to physical integrity" of the unvaccinated.  https://t.co/Q1bNkzhhW0
===
@HMethodistCV @AlanLumsdenMD @trisharoymd @MujeebZubair You are evil and should be shut down. How dare you demand your employees take the vax or be fired. That is illegal with an experimental vaccine. This means ALL your doctors and employees are toxic because of virus shedding.

Pfizer developed the vaccine and they were not part of "operation warp speed". They self funded their work.

.@CENTCOM spox: US military ‚Äúconducted an over-the-horizon counterterrorism operation today against an ISIS-K planner. The unmanned airstrike occurred in the Nangahar Province of Afghanistan. Initial indications are that we killed the target. We know of no civilian casualties."

The Pentagon just successfully carried out a precision drone strike against ISIS-K, the group responsible for the airport bombing, killing their target. President Biden said yesterday, ‚ÄúWe will hunt you down and make you pay." He just delivered on that promise.

The strike on ISIS-K is the start of payback.  Congratulations to our military and good call from Pres. Biden.  Nothing will recover our loss of men, but it cannot go unanswered.

On May 13 @Hounsizzle reported that NIH funded Peter Daszak/EcoHealth Alliance's study
"Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence" at Wuhan as an example that Dr. #FauciLied to @RandPaul. We FOIA'd progress rpts but have been stonewalled. https://t.co/zThrdpJMzg

Documents obtained by @theintercept prove the US did indeed fund coronavirus research at the Wuhan lab.

@RandPaul called this months ago. 

@HannahDCox reported on it for us months ago. 

Still no apology from Fauci who tried to deny it to congress. https://t.co/cGY4AkF7Jc

Fauci's NIH funded DANGEROUS gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Laboratory. The same man that wants to mask your kids and keep us LOCKED DOWN forever helped cause this pandemic. How does he still have a job? Fauci needs to be FIRED and INVESTIGATED immediately! https://t.co/BkCvMD1gDt

Vax mandates make 0 sense. People who‚Äôve had Covid have antibodies that are more effective than the vaccine. Vaccinated people can get and spread Covid. This has unintended consequences like Chicago school bus drivers quitting and parents having to Uber their kids to school.

Please ask yourself, "Why is the USA requiring vaccination for all with an outdated vax, when many have already been infected, recovered, developed natural immunity?".  Stop. Think. Why the censorship? Why the mandates? Why the constant propaganda push?

OK, here is the next question for consideration.  Why has virtually every single medical professional organization in the USA come out against early outpatient treatment of COVID-19? Particularly when "rogue" physicians who practice early treatment have outstanding results?

Denying religious &amp; medical exemptions is unconstitutional. It is a completely illegal mandate that violates the Nuremberg Code. 

Fight for your freedom.
===
Now imagine if everyone everywhere did the same thing that the people at Southwest Airlines are doing.
===
Met one of the Southwest pilots striking. While asking for directions to a shuttle. 

Look at his patriot drip https://t.co/FMq6uzEH1K
===
I can confirm this is true. A number of elected officials have reached out to me over the last year and requested this treatment. https://t.co/Cc42OHKZxl
===
Since this is a Constitutional republic and mandates are not Constitutional I choose to ignore them...what say you folks
===
The deafening political silence and bizarre media coverups/gaslighting you‚Äôve heard regarding one transportation-related disaster after another lately is what happens when you appoint a Secretary of Transportation whose only qualification is that he likes trains.

" What's going on" a customer on video asking a (SW) Air Pilot~ Pilot responds 
" I'm not taking the vaccination" of all places, I heard this on (WLS- AM890) 

It's not the weather or poor planning 

This is what pushback looks like folks
===
Praying for Southwest today. They are being forced to cancel thousands of flights due to weather conditions that only affect their airplanes and nobody else's. Very unique weather phenomenon.
===
I wanna personally thank all those (SW) airline pilots for rejuvenating the entire country
===
There are millions of people who believe the rona vaxxine stops you from getting it and stops you from spreading it.

Both the CDC director and US president made this claim earlier this year...

It's a lie.

Same people will claim we are the ones 'spreading misinformation'.
===
Not only is it false, but many of the policies and mandates being proposed and implemented are based on this completely false premise.

Beyond being unethical, they don't even make scientific nor logical sense.

At best, the shots only protect the individual. Somewhat.

This is Grace Smith.

Grace is a 16-year-old junior at Laramie High School who was arrested and removed from school in handcuffs.

Texas just banned vaccine mandates 

Southwest is headquartered in Dallas 

Who blinks first?

#FreedomFlu
===
Quickest way to end Unconstitutional mandates is by not doing business with any company enforcing them... who's with me
===
Texas just banned vaccine mandates... which is convenient because Southwest is headquartered in Dallas.
===
I just recently passed a (D.O.T) physical they cleared me for another (2) yrs so why would I take a chance of taking an experimental vaccine... sorry but no thx

Personally I consider Nurses, Pilots and Cops to be the brightest among us, so when you see them walking rather than getting jabbed, I trust their judgment.. DON'T YOU..
===
(50%) of Chgo's (P.D) is threatening to walk off the job by this weekend if they are forced to take the vaccine... 

IT'S HAPPENING FOLKS..THIS IS REAL
===
Hurry up and get a bottle of aspirin folks before they ban it..bc it works against Covid... it's a miracle..
===
Hospitalisation rates ARE lower amongst people who have had the vaxx.

It is a symptom mitigator, as we've established. But doesn't stop people from getting it nor spreading it. So that particular narrative needs to go... ASAP. https://t.co/fdP4QDe1eO

A Federal Judge in Texas has told United Airlines it must halt its plan to put its unvaccinated employees on leave.

God Bless the Federal Judge President Trump appointed who just blocked the illegal United Airlines vaccine mandate

600 United Airlines workers may have been saved by a smart judge who deemed their vaccine mandate illegal.

Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin should be sold over the counter. The citizens will take care of themselves, free of the medical industry
===
Vitamin D, C, B, Zinc, Magnesium..... and Hydroxychloroquine or Ivermectin....if you can get a Dr. to prescribe.  

That‚Äôs the tweet
===
These nurses went from 'heroes' to villains in less than one year.

Amazing.

Meanwhile we all know the shot doesn't stop you from getting the virus nor spreading it. https://t.co/56baW4wXl8
===
Sure. As I've said many times, it's a short term symptom mitigator. To even call it a 'vaccine' they had to redefine the word.

A TRUE vaccine prevents infection and transmission. That's why comparing it to measles, smallpox, etc. is dumb/dishonest. https://t.co/KtkgLDFhUo
===
4.3 million workers quit their jobs. We need to quit paying folks not to work.
===
CNN and @DonLemon are pathetic. There is zero ambiguity they lied about Joe Rogan. They told viewers he took horse dewormer: a 100% lie. He took the human version of ivermectin prescribed by his medical doctor.

But as I said, lying is not frowned upon at CNN: it's encouraged. https://t.co/XIkYGx8UWX
===
It's true that ivermectin is not approved for treatment of COVID. That has nothing with the lie CNN told.

They said Rogan took horse dewormer. He didn't. And CNN and Don Lemon are such little people, with so little integrity, they can't admit they lied.
===
The fascist NBA won‚Äôt let Kyrie Irving play for refusing a vaccine. 

But yet they still let Magic Johnson play with HIV.
===
Did you know that Ivermectin has been used by brave doctors around the world to treat COVID-19 for over a year now, and it only recently became the target of a multi-pronged attack, thanks to Big Pharma, the media and the US government? #Ivermectin

https://t.co/zDSNShOK9A

I have COVID-19.

And let me tell you, it's no joke. It felt like the flu on steroids.

THANKFULLY, my incredible doctor prescribed me with Ivermectin and I have been feeling MUCH better lately.

A full recovery is on the way, I will keep everyone updated.
===
Joe Rogan cured his COVID with Ivermectin
===
Question;
Has anyone died from using Ivermectin 

Very strange how bad people say it is but I haven't heard anyone dying bc of it 

Have you..?
===
Kids are not at risk for Covid.

Things people told me I was 'crazy' for doing:

-lifting weights from age 15
-pursuing a rap career with an Oxford degree
-leaving my cushy corporate job
-intermittent fasting
-buying bitcoin in 2017-18
-not drinking alcohol
-not watching TV

A lot of 'advice' should be ignored.
===
I‚Äôve been a Registered Nurse for 25 years. Why should I be mandated to take a vaccine that Congress and the USPS don‚Äôt have too? Am I or my job less important than theirs?
===
The thing about paternity leave is there isn't much for dad to do when the baby is a newborn, especially if mom is breastfeeding. His main role is to take care of mom as she recovers but of course that doesn't apply to Buttigieg so I'm not sure why he needs paternity leave at all

New Covid-CCP cases in Florida are down 88%.

Do you find it at all odd that the makers of the Vax Pfizer (J&amp;J) &amp; Moderna all (3) exempt their employees from it.. now why is that... ?? What do they know that we don't know

COVID is rapidly disappearing in Florida without mask or vaccine mandates. Proof that natural immunity and therapeutics work!
===
Obesity is the biggest risk factor for hospitalizations and death for Covid.

The biggest wake up call for America should be lose weight and take care of yourself instead of living like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. 

Not judging one another and mandating vaccines crippling our economy.
